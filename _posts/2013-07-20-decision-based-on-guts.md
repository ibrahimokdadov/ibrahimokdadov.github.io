I guess many would argue with me on this; feel free to…however there are many aspects to it, i understand…but i like to think of it this way:  
If I do not feel comfortable with whatever decision even when I have numbers to back that decision I take my time to think about it.

I understand that there is a chance that I am only afraid to take the chance, but hey I decided not to think like that ever since I decided to become an entrepreneur. I do not think it is always right to just take the risks; there are risks of risks. You can’t just blindly jump into a pool of sharks and believe you can swim out safely. I am not saying to never take risks….wait I think I drifting of my main topic here. risk is a very long topic to talk about; so I will leave it for some other time…

now back to what I was saying…I do consider my “guts’ feelings” If i do not feel right about something; I take my time to think about it. Mainly I ask myself; why am I not feeling right? sometimes it is easy to answer that question (because I am afraid of failure…etc). and sometimes it is just tough, sometimes you just can’t find out why you are not feeling comfortable with whatever decision..here I believe that’s because experience drives that feeling; something like deja vu…if i think thats the case i like to re-decide my decision ^^
