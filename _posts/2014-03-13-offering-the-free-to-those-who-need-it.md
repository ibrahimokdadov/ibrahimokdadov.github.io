One thing I see worth doing when starting up with your business is to invest in those with limited resources. Wait! I will explain what I mean.

Before i go on let me clarify that I will be talking about a method that can be adopted along other execution methods, so ya&#8230;

Usually when a small new born business is starting up it struggles with acquiring customers (passed the early adopters stage). One approach I see many doing is offering discounts and/or free stuff to attract  customers to at least try the products. Well that sure works (source: experience) and is quite attractive for customers, however you have to balance and work out how much is free (I stand with those that offer the free with the complete meaning of the word; unlike the type that offer the free but I have to bare the spams, the advertisements, the watermarks and &#8230;.etc you get the point; I see that a bad thing to do; I will leave this for another post so I would not branch to another talk) back to what I was saying about offering the free. When you are offering the free to customers; I recon you spend some time looking for those talents that might benefit from your service but are lacking the resources (could be money) to pay you; since you are offering the free  anyway why not invest some time finding those in need of your service but cannot pay you?

I see it very effective . I will not talk about loyalty built on the customer or any of that, it can be your goal I do not know. But if you ask me about the affect I will tell you it is enough that you feel that your startup made someone&#8217;s life different to the better.
