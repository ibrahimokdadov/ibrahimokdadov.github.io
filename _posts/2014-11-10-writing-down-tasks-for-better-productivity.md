I have been reading articles about productivity and how to be productive, I think the best I have read from so far are Oliver Emberton and David Ellen. Each of them (along with the rest of the writers and speakers) has a technique that in most of the time is different than the other person&#8217;s.

As you read about the subject you will realize that several techniques exist and one has to try them to know which works best. We are all different we have different personalities, different habits and different determination levels. I have tried many techniques but one that has worked best not only for me but for a lot more others is to write down your daily task down on a paper and hang it in front of you. Upon the completion of each task scratch if off that list (remember new list for each day).

I think the reason this worked best is the feeling of accomplishment you get when scratching something off the list, as well as it somehow renews your concentration since you will be diverting your mind off the thing you were working on to scratch that task, it is like preparing your mind to work on the nextÂ item on that list.
