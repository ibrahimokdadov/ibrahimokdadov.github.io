Whenever I tend to buy something, I tend to do my research online and _used to_ rarely ever consider the sellers opinion. As it happened to many of us and across many events we were fooled by the seller. Daniel Pink in his book _To sell is Human_ talked about this and how that has changes over the past years. In the old times there was what he called **information asymmetry** were the seller knew way more than the buyer and that created the trust issue currently associated with the term salesman/saleswomen. In current times when salesman/saleswomen is mentioned bad definitions and/or words cross ones mind. One major one is dishonesty many regarded sales job as sneaky dishonest work done by the sales personnel. Fortunately now the Internet happened that fear from sales people and their honesty has degraded tremendously. Nowadays we do not need no sales person&#8217;s opinion, you just Google for the information you are looking for. You might expect me to say now let us just get rid of them or just ignore them entirely. Well I would be wrong to say that. That is why I am writing this blog post. I tend to ask the sales man to aid my decision in buying from that place. Almost every product can be obtained from multiple places such that several stores in most cases sell the same product. Now for me to decide from which to buy I ask the sales person about the product or service and if they gave an honest answer similar to what I have read online I get what I wanted from them with a happy face. otherwise if the sales person had no idea what he was talking about or tried to trick me that would be the last time they would see my face (of course I would also tell them that). Here is an example that happened to me yesterday 29th October 2014. I headed out with couple of friends for lunch. we entered this restaurant that had two dinning areas, one that looked fancy and the other looked normal, normal restaurant tables, A/C, chairs and was clean. As we went inside, it happened that went inside the normal dinning area, so the servers that worked there approached us and asked us to go to the next area, we did not fully understand why, we thought there was some servicing going on, but we could see people sitting and eating in the normal area. It turned out that the fancy place charged extra for the plates than the normal place, mind you they have only one kitchen to serve both areas. It is like they wanted to rob us by not allowing us to sit in the normal area. I talked to the man next to the register and told him why such a notion? he replied &#8220;there is no A/C&#8221;; believe me there were two A/Cs in that normal area and they were working and I saw them.
