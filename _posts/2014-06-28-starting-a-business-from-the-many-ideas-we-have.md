<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">I am certain that we all have nice business ideas, some of us might have them written down and most just store somewhere in our minds for when we are &#8220;free&#8221; to start executing them. </span>

I am not writing today about how to come up with the right idea nor am I going to write about how to make yourself execute an idea. I am going to write about the case where you have variety of ideas in your mind and you want to start with one, but you can&#8217;t, simply because according to you all are great ideas. Now which one to choose?

You know what they say &#8220;**firs**t things first&#8221; start by writing those ideas down (if they are not). write them down one after the other.

The **second** step would to be prioritize them according to your view of importance&#8230;Which you think is most important put it first and least important put it last. The reason why this step is very important is for you to know your &#8220;why&#8221;; such that your motive or your goal to doing any of them. For example if you prioritized according to value on society than clearly you want to work on something that has value; if for example you prioritized according to what makes more money than clearly your number one priority is to make money; I think you got the notion of what I mean. So, know and clarify your intentions of creating something. :

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The next important step (<strong>Third</strong> step), which is deciding which to start with. This point is the main reason for this post. Now that you have prioritized them according to what you intend to do, pick the first half and ask these questions:</span>

&#8211; Is this your first attempt to start a business? If it is not recall all that has gone wrong in your previous attempts and/or businesses; and see which of those idea is most vulnerable to those mistakes  and lower its priority or even take it out of the list (I understand you will try your best not to make the same mistakes again; but still, which of those idea can easily fall into that trap even with you trying not to, remember, some mistakes are out of your control for example stuff related to type of establishment or even legal documents required).

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  If it is your first attempt, remember start small and simple; reorganize your top half of your list from simplest to most complicated. Always, if it is your first attempt, think of the simplest (your number one goal is to minimize the risks and you can&#8217;t do that with complicated ideas).
</p>

&#8211; Money Money and Money, How much of it do I have? from the start know your limits; don&#8217;t hope for money you do not own. If you intend to borrow, borrow the minimum possible (avoid this if possible)  the moment you borrow money you are adding to your list of risks try to keep it minimum.  Now that you know how much money you can have you can further modify your list to the ideas you can afford.

&#8211; How much time can you invest? You know what they say &#8220;time is money?&#8221; it is very very true. If an idea requires a lot of time that could translate to years to start I suggest you minimize its priority (unless of course you have enough money to survive that period and you are sure that your idea is super super). You see, with whatever idea you will decide on executing or have decided that it is the most important for you to start with, know something, only money coming for it will validate its success, so you do not want to spend a lot of time to get the results/proofs and that is the fundamentals of the Lean startup methodology (in which you minimize the risks and if it is to fail it will fail fast rather than invest a lot just to know later that this is not what customers want _ one should be very careful here on differentiating pessimism and realism; this is not about working for failure it is about knowing the bits that might lead to failing and avoiding them).

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">After those questions you should have a better view on which ideas to begin investigating and </span>working<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> on pick the first in the list. your next step would to be go out and put down hypotheses and put them to test; know your problem(s) very well and the people that you are solving for and ways you could reach them; talk to them and see what they want. Also you should know when you should break even and underline it; take it further and translate the time you need to money (how much do you get paid for an hour if you were employed).</span>
