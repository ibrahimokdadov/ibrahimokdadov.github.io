I was going through my notes the other day and I came across a paper that I titled with a quote saying &#8220;_**When we understand our customers, we understand how to grow our business**_&#8220;. I did not write down who said this but I will try to look it up.

In the note I Â wrote down some nice points I will list the most important ones.

So yes, one point many seem to know and understand is how many visitors hit your site?; I see that a very important thing to know if will be utilized properly. It is the key to something great. With it you can efficiently work your way towards moving visitors to becoming customers. Clearly starting with where are those hits are coming from.

The source of your visitors is a very important key metric, through it you can know a lot of details especially ones about the marketing efforts you are making that work. This also begets another point of understanding your surroundings and what are your triggers. Say for example many of your visitors reach you from Malaysia; you would start working on the first why. Why are they coming most from Malaysia; i can simply assume that they need something like yours. See here you might have had something else in your mind as to why they might be visiting you from Malaysia the most; and that is the beauty of it, you have a lot you can work on/with.

Moving on to the next important point. When a visitor lands at your site, things should be interesting enough, that would at least make him try what you are offering or even read more about what you are offering. Try your very best not to lose your customers as soon as they land at your site. One way to ensure their stay is to have a decent design/discount/valuable information&#8230;.etc. Â I bet you could thing of aloot of ideas to achieve that. I am honestly thinking of trying say an interactive game on the homepage. not much details nothing just plain interactive thingy; QA, or a javascript game anything just something interactive and see that result. If you did or will do something like that do fill us in with the result.

So ya those were the key important points I noted down in my note; I hope it helped and happy acquiring more customers ðŸ˜‰

Have a good day
