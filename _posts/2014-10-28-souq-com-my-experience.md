Souq.com is like Amazon.com for the middle east. Well to be precise it is like Amazon.com for GCC (Currently, UAE, Saudi and Kuwait) add to the list Egypt. They have some great offerings and from where I stand, it is even cheaper then the supermarkets here.

I am making the comparison here with supermarkets because as you may know supermarkets are generally cheaper than private shops since they sell wide range of products and stock big that gives them flexibility on prices. 

I was saying about souq.com that it has great offerings. I decided to give it a try and I placed my purchase. I keyed in my credit card details and everything and before my order was confirmed there was another step, which I think was a bit frustrating but I guess it is the only way here. I had to upload a scan of the card I used (be careful just the front side), a copy of my ID and a form signed that I grant souq.com permission to deduct the cost from the card. I personally think there are other ways to validate which can be easier and smoother. I guess each has their policies and regulations that best suits their situations. Before I validated my card I wanted to cancel my order because I landed on a coupon that would save me 100 Dirhams per purchase. The only way to cancel was I either email them (which was very slow) or simply just give them a call at their call center and give them the order ID and they will cancel it immediately. On my second attempt I placed the order with the coupon and I got my discount and had to give them another call to check the verification process because it took 2 days and the status on the order &#8220;processing&#8221; was still there. after I called the operator, the status changed.  
The shipment should not take long to arrive probably something between 2-3 days. 

So all in all it is a great service, you have to make some efforts when it is your first purchase just so you do the necessary validation and after that you are okay to go. One advice I would put forth is shop wisely don&#8217;t be tempted to buy what you think is cheap as you may not need it.

**UPDATE**: Keep an eye on Mondays there is a coupon code that can be obtained from the mobile app (saves your 100 Dirhams)

have a good day.
