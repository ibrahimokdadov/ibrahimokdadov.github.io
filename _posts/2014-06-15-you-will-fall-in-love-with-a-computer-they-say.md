I read this post a while ago &#8216;[Humans will be able to fall in love with computers within the next 15 years](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/humans-will-be-able-to-fall-in-love-with-computers-within-the-next-15-years-9537040.html)&#8216; and I thought half way reading why am I even reading this? well&#8230;I know why but I am just trying to act dramatic here.

I read it because it was kind of interesting and curious or something in between I am not exactly sure how to describe that; but that is not the important bit. I personally think that this is a ridiculous thing. Wait! before you judge me let me explain. I will be frank and straight forward. Why on earth would I fall for a machine? or even want to to fall for a machine? In my perspective love is not something you can simply plugin and play or code; it does not come in pills that you just swallow and voila you are in love. Love is not all being smart, romantic, funny  and knows how to react to emotions, it is something deeper than, It goes to touch on actions; it is something that has to do with soul not matter how smart you act or are it is not like you will be loved.

Falling in love touches deeper to the soul; I will leave you with this saying  &#8220;Love can be heard in the deadliest silence&#8221; *I could not find out who said it&#8230;in that sense my computer has been silent for ages I think it loves me&#8230;oh dear&#8230;
