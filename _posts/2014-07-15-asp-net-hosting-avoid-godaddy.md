Godaddy I guess is one of the most popular hosting sites out there. Its for that reason (aside from they provided asp.net hosting and that is what I needed) I thought of getting a host with them. Well not thought I already did. The interface is not bad but unfortunately the service is rubbish. I could not even get close to getting my site up and running. I even tried a simple site with static pages and that too did not work smoothly. I will be honest here their support team is incredible those folks behind the phone are very friendly but unfortunately the service is not. So I went on to opt out and try another.

If you are looking for asp.net hosting take it from me avoid goDaddy go for something else. I would recommend smarterasp.net (5 starts)
