I used numerous hosts; believe me when I say GreenGeeks stands among them. The popular hostings you can think of I have tried. iPage, Arvixe, Dreamhost, Hostgator, Justhost, 1&1&#8230;etc

Truth be told Hostgator is amazing solution however it can be costly. iPage is also good however it has limitations on the php version database version; If you want a simple wordpress hosting iPage could be a good option. Arvixe Grrr; I used to be fan not any more. I once had to wait 1 hour 30 minutes on the phone just get through to support. Their last year is terrible especially when it comes to support. I once had a ticketÂ pending for more than a week. Their servers break more than usual. The last problem I had with them was the Database server. One ofÂ my sites was down for 6 days. I do not have to talk about 1&1 and dreamhost their panel is hard to work with and takes alot of time. Anyways this post is not about complaining about those hosts I am here to recommend a hosting I loved. I hope they will not change.

What I like about them:

  * Up to date software
  * Fast servers
  * Fast support
  * Affordable in the long run (meaning is not as expensive to renew as other hosts)
  * Environmental Friendly ðŸ™‚

Here is a link you can use (disclaimer: this link is an affiliation link; I loved them so much I signed up for their affiliation program and it is the only program am signed in and in no other host)
