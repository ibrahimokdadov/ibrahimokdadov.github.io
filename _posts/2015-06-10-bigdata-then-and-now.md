  The reason I am writing this post is because I think this will help in understanding bigdata. When I was working on my Masters and tried to explain the concept of my research to others I found that many at first thought of bigdata as it is something new and that it was a replacement for the traditional way of handling data and that it was about database and SQL. That is why with this post (and the previous posts <a href="http://ibrahimokdad.com/2015/04/30/bigdata-the-basics/">Bigdata, the Basics</a> and <a href="http://ibrahimokdad.com/2015/05/16/bigdata-in-practice-examples-from-science-and-social-platforms/">BigData in practice…Examples from Science and Social Platforms</a>) am trying to build the basis of understanding bigdata.

  Alright with that cleared, let us go ahead with this post.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is something many starting with bigdata tend to do and is stating a number to bigdata. Well it is not something one should do; because whats that number to large corporate? yesterday’s bigdata is today&#8217;s norm. Think 1995 personal computers. Their memory, disk capacities and processor. Back then a decent computer capacity would be something around ~1GB and a decent RAM would be ~4MB. Those numbers back then used to be something but now you probably laughed at them. Take a look at the ads below (I could find a its original source; as a disclaimer: I do not own this photo nor it is mine)

  The ad image above of a computer of 4 MB RAM and 420 MB hard disk that costed $1599,94 reveales alot. Starting with the overall cost then and now, the processor speed now and then, Disk capacity now and then and RAM capacity now and then. Now new technologies emerged new hardware and software that made huge leap forward.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bigdata is not something new, big corporations (oil companies, telecommunications&#8230;etc) have had big data for years. It is a hype now because it is accessible to almost anyone and cheaply. Then corporations invested huge amounts of money to build data warehouses to try to work with the data they have. This meant only big corporations have that much data and could afford to work on it. However it should be noted that that in itself was limited. The conventional data warehouses usually or mostly used the traditional relational databases where everything was bounded to predefined schema; so whatever newly data to be fed or added has to be constrained to that schema. So explorations or analysis is only done over what the schema states. Now that all is changing. Now there are techniques and technologies emerged that allowed to work beyond a defined schema.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  One of the reasons that caused such changes is competition. Then organizations did not bother studying much data simply because they did not see a need. Then many companies thought of data generated as a symbol that a business is going well. Many did not go beyond that. However now competition is fiercer than it used to be and more and more businesses showing; that led companies and organizations to study it to keep up with the competition. Say you are a company and have 100000 customers visiting you daily and you track their actions to provide better experience and all; say each user generates  500KB of information that would be 50GB of information a day. By the end of the month you will end up with 1500 GB of tracking info; and that is a single source only.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Another reason that contributed to the change on how data is treated and obtained is the Application Program Interface (API). APIs have enabled access to many sources of information of different kinds. Sometime back data was only limited to a given corporate data warehouse and for data warehouse given schemes, one could not go beyond. Now corporations and companies allow access to what they want through APIs. You can only imagine the possibilities of merging different data from different sources with you own data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now when you have different sources and/or generating data and it can reach a stage (especially if aggregated together) where it becomes quite troublesome to work with; be it because of lack of tools or talent then you are in what they call now a bigdata problem. To get by you have to start thinking beyond the conventional tools you have or are using.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As data grow ways of handling it should also grow (Grow in this post also referring to adapt). Your data started 10GB and grew to 100GB? The first thing that should grow is the disk space to host it. Now growing the disk space on its own is not enough. You have to grow other things alongside, especially the way you read and write. Say for example in windows the disk format FAT grew from being limited to 4GB file size and 2TB partitions to NTFS format which goes beyond that. The growth in data means the growth in the way we handle and see data. That change and the fact that data is easily accessible now made many divert their attention to solving the problems that come along and aiding in making the growth happen much smoother.
