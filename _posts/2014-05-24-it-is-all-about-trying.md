Here is a quick thought I want to put out there.

You see one of the beautiful things of being of a tech background is that you can learn any new technology  
with ease (be it a new scripting language, API, SDKs&#8230;etc); trust me no matter how novice you are (well you would at  
least know data structure (if logic, loops, variables&#8230;etc) and how computers work and operate),  
trust me, you will do wonders; all you need is a clear objective/idea/thing to do.

The moment you start with new code you will realize that the logic is almost the same and you can achieve  
a lot of things with the basics that you already know. Don&#8217;t fear not knowing.

My point is you do not have to be a pro to start something; you will learn in the process.

Here is a quick real story, When I was in college I took a course were we had to develop a basic Â website. I had  
basic knowledge on how things work and that project was not so difficult so I pulled it off without much  
issues. However the fear of doing big projects with fancy UI and the much functionality Â was always there. Simply because I did not know how. BUTÂ hey &#8230; one day I decided I should try it, I should take on a project in the worst case scenario I will just give the money back&#8230;.So ya with google and stackoverflow much came to shine and I realized it was simply because I did not know.

Listen you are a techies person? you can do it if you try ðŸ˜‰ (* Movies reflect this alot&#8230;it is true ðŸ™‚ )
