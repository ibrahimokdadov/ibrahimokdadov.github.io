I will try to keep this one short and to the point. This is not one of my usual technical posts. This post is a review on gulf sea cars dealer and the summary is:

_**&#8220;If you can find another place to buy a car do.&#8221;**_

So these guys sell second hand cars. I must tell you that their prices are not that cheap. You can get better deals if you look and spend more time.

Let me share my hands on experience.

I was looking for a second hand car. Instead of buying from individuals I thought dealers are more reliable (oh boy I was wrong) So I went to this dealer _**Gulf Sea Cars**_ at the time of this posting they were in Salmaniya; they most promote cars for expatriates. So I was welcomed by the employees there and asked what I wanted. One of them showed me some options and sold me big talk. &#8220;We are reliable&#8221;, &#8220;Accident free cars&#8221;, &#8220;Company cars&#8221;&#8230;etc You will hear the exact same tape if you head over there. This begets the first advise:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 1: Do not fully trust what they tell you.</span>

I asked them if they are sure their cars are accident free they told me yes and that they have a garage and before they bring in any car they take it to their garage for inspection and then and only then they show it in their showroom.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 2: Do not trust their garage work.</span>

I believed what they said, given their long existence in the market. Also I could not find any reviews on them online. So, I thought they are good. I locked my choice on one of their cars; given I urgently needed the car and had to spend 100+ BD on previous car inspections. I thought this is it. Especially the guy told me if I decided to sell the car they are willing to buy it back from me at the market&#8217;s price.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 3: Always take any car for inspection.</span>

I paid for the car I locked my choice on (they will do the paper work for you). So I came the next day to pick the car and to my surprise the car was damaged O.O I was shocked given I did not see it before deciding. I mean I checked the car and all and this time the damage was evident it hit me right in the face the moment I took a look inside. I told the guy that sold me the car about the damage and showed it to him. He seemed surprised him self. He told me to choose any other car from the room. So I went ahead and picked one he recommended (one that one of his employees was driving). This time however I made sure I execute advise 3. I took the car for a thorough inspection.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 4: Watch out before buying a car with damaged consumables</span>

So after I took the car for inspection some weird issues showed. Not in the engine nor the chassis mostly mounts, bushings and suspension as well as brakes and tyres. I understand these items are consumable but believe me you do not want to buy a car with all of those parts damaged.  Before I say anything the fixes cost me 600+BD. Of course original parts. Some advised me to go for commercial and such however I like to act safe on this one. If I knew I will have to spend that much on fixing the car I would have never bought it. Note that the car it self was not cheap.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 5: Always verify the fixing cost.</span>

After I took the car for inspection (also turned out the car had a minor accident and was fixed; however body work nothing to the engine). I passed by a garage for an estimate on the fixing costs, they told me 300+ BD. I went to the dealer and told him; he was a bit furious given the place I took the car to were a bit detailed and he said something that I honestly should have considered. _I am buying a second hand car not a brand new car_

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 6: Remember that you are buying a second hand car.</span>

Even though I am buying a second hand car. I do not want to buy a car that I will be spending alot on it. One of the reasons you are buying a second hand car is that you do not want to spend a lot on a new car.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 7:  There are many cars for sale. Be patient.</span>

After a long talk with the dealer I decided to take  the car. Given I did not know it will cost me 600+BD to fix; plus he told me if I fix it in their garage it will not cost more than 100+ BD, but I did not want to do that I suspected their work after the first attempt (advise 2)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 8: Yhey will not buy the car back from you</span>

half way fixing the car; some other issues started to show; but then I had spend 400 BD on the car; I picked the phone and gave the guy a call. I told him that costs are raising propose a solution. Honestly I offered he buys the car back. but he told they can&#8217;t do that &#8220;n_ow&#8221;_ given the showroom is full. however they will call me if they found someone interested in buying a good car. I also proposed I get at least some money back. Because totaling the cost of the car and the money I spent fixing it would result in an amount I could buy a brand new car for the dealer of the same brand however a smaller type.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advise 9: They will try to keep you; they offer a replacement option</span>

Honestly they offered me a solution which was choosing another car from their room; however I had spend much on the one I took so I thought I would not know if the other car will not have the same fate.

Here is the last piece of info you should know: The car turned out to be a rental car. Oh yes a rental car. No wonder all those parts were damaged at 45k+ mileage . The guy told me it was a company car and the employees drove it. He did not lie however it was a sneaky answer. Rental cars employees drive their company&#8217;s rental cars for their daily activities. The way I found out was by using a led light on the back window and found the sticker trace on it.

Now the bottom line. If you are want to get a rental car you could go to budget showroom or something. At least they maintain their cars unlike this one. despite it being a rental car it was not maintained properly.

Now it is your call. Make it wise.
