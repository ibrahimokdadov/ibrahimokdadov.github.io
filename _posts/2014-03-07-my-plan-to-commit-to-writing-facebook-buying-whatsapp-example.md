I had several failed attempts to commit to writing and I will keep on trying until I coomit.  
I will start documenting how I am doing that hoping it would on itself be a mean for me to commit.

I understand I do not have to write several paragraphs; instead several lines would suffice. This way I would practice the term &#8220;short and precise&#8221; and also would motivate me to writing even more. In a way that I would not be demotivated feeling that I have to write long paragraphs which might make me feel a bit lazy and hence delay writing until I realize that I forgot about it.

So my current strategy is to write about whatever interesting thing or news I read in a day and just comment about it. Say for example facebook buying Whatsapp I will just write down my thoughts which ever comes to mind, that way I will practice and get used to writing.

So for Facebook buying Whatsapp; First of all doing so means Facebook users would commit even more and also Facebook  would know even more stuff about individuals say it is for &#8220;better customer experience&#8221;, I call it (Stalking-tracking-invading privacy&#8230;etc); i also think it is one way to get into Markets where Facebook is not very common in maybe places like China? I am not sure about that last one but it may be a door? I am not sure if Whatsapp is banned in China or not but if it is not then clearly it is an open door to get into that market. I understand in this talk I am much focused on privacy issue because with complete honesty I do not see it any other way. Facebook basically bought the huge customer base  Whatsapp has, their contacts (and Lives) especially that phone numbers are what connects your contacts in Whatsapp. With the recent NSA stuff coming to shine I prefer my information (given that I am very important person :P) I would prefer switching to other &#8220;better&#8221; possibilities like Line and Telegram. Oh boy I loved that message from the founders of Whatsapp about why Whatsapp does not have any ads on it&#8230;.

I understand that there are many other reasons why Facebook bought Whatsapp but I chose to mention this because it is a point to argue alot about&#8230;  
Ah well I think I wrote enough for today&#8217;s post; I really enjoyed writing this piece; I hope my enthusiasm would live on to better pieces&#8230;.

alright then I will just stop here for now and have a good day&#8230;
