I want to write today about something I think would be valuable to many. It is something I learnt in my recent visit to the US. True I did learn a lot of things but this thing stuck on my head and I keep thinking about it all the time.

Before I say what that thing is and you have probably guessed from the title, I want to tell you _where_ and _when_ I learnt what I want to tell you now.

You see part of my visit to the US was to participate in the Intel challenge competition Finals (I am part of EXA.io team &#8211; cloud based 3D rendering service (<a title="Check it out here" href="http://exa.io" target="_blank">check it out</a> ;)). The finals were of two stages; the first stage was called the &#8220;_poster session_&#8221; and the second which is the final stage is _presenting in-front of the judges(CEOs, VCs and Managers)_. The poster session was like a filter because only 8 teams were to present and not all. The 8 were chosen by different judges in the _poster session_. Each team designed a poster that would describe their Startup. Each team would have 4 separate judges to assess them. Each judge has from 10-15 minutes with each team. Each team would pitch their idea to each judge and answer their questions; and accordingly the judge would assess the team and later on decide on who qualifies to the final 8.

Fortunately we were of the eight that qualified to the final round of the competition. Now for what I want to write about/tell you in the post.

I was and I believe so were the rest of the teams expecting normal questions about their startups. Questions like:

_-What is your unique value proposition,_

_-Who are your customers,_

_-How big is your market and similar question;_

I and my team were totally prepared for such questions and we answered them quite well. What we were not expecting are these questions:

**-Why would I give you my money?**

**-What are your concerns in investors?**

**-Why do you think you are better than the other teams?**

**-Why do you think your idea is more valuable than the other ideas?**

Those questions got stuck on my head and I am always thinking about them; They are great questions that would make you think about a lot of things.  
I want to leave room for you to answer the questions on your own just to see how well you think you are prepared; if you already know the answers I would also kindly ask you to think of them one more time; I think it feels good knowing the answers.

Something else I would like to add. When we were asked the questions we **took sometime to think** about the answers and from the feedback we got after the results were out, is that the fact that we took sometime to think about the answers was highly admired by the judge and meant that we just did not dive into answering but rather took time to reason our answers and that is a tip I take seriously, as for now whenever I am asked a question I am not prepared for I ask for few seconds or take few seconds to think about the answer before I talk. People appreciate that.

So ya I guess that&#8217;s all I wanted to say in this post; those questions are very important. Also always take time to answer the questions you are not prepared for.

And Thank you for baring with me&#8230;  
I would love to know what you think..
