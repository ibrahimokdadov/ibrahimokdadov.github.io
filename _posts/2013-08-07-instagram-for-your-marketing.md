I was listening to the “Best Marketing Advise You’re Not Following, Episode 4” and a very interesting point was put forth by Lewis Howes that I kinda did not consider before, and is the use of Instagram for your marketing and the fact that it may even be better.

remember “a picture for a thousand words?” that’s exactly what Lewis said to justify why instagram can actually be amazing and do you wonders for your marketing campaign/strategy.

I will do a quick research and see how companies using instagram and how are they actually doing ….

I guess I will be updating this with more later…
