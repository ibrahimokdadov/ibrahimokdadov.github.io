I am in office now; and I am writing this post with an immense frustration…I am actually writing this post offline, in notepad without Internet connection. I will just copy/paste it “whenever” i get connection. my location is Hidd Industrial area not far from Asri; my connection is VIVA the supposdly to be 4G…We paid that much just to get shocked that the speed does not even reach 3MB at best…I do respect the fact that it may run well elsewhere (it does)…but come on i pay for my connection i should at least get what I pay for O.o else why would I waste my money…I will tweet them right now….Ops no connection

Update:  
Just tweeted them, they were fast on replying back, that I got to respect…I shall wait and see what happens…will it change?

Update:

I did contact them again….I was ignored… sad
