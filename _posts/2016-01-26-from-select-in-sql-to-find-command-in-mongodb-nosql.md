In one of the questions in stackoverflow about understanding the mongodb select query (findÂ command in mongodb) I replied with the content below. The reason I am posting this here is to document it for other users who might need this piece of information.

Note: Consider the version you are running. Since the latest version has new features and functions.

To verify pymongo version you are using execute the following:

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint prettyprinted"><code>&lt;span class="kwd">import&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln"> pymongo
pymongo&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">version&lt;/span></code></pre>

Now. Regarding the select query you asked for. As far as I can tell the code you presented is fine. Here is the select structure in mongodb.

First off it is called **find()**.

In pymongo; if you want to select specific rows( **not** really **rows** in mongodb they are called documents. I am saying rows to make it easy to understand. I am assuming you are comparing mongodb to SQL); alright so If you want to select specific document from the table (called **collection**in mongodb) use the following structure (I will use **random** as collection name; also assuming that the random table has the following attributes: **age:10, type:ninja, class:black, level:1903**):

`db.random.find({ "age":"10" })` This will return all documents that have age 10 in them.

you could add more conditions simply by separating with **commas**

`db.random.find({ "age":"10", "type":"ninja" })` This will select all data with age 10 and type ninja.

if you want to get all data just leave empty as:

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint prettyprinted"><code>&lt;span class="pln">db&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">random&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">find&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">({})&lt;/span></code></pre>

Now the previous examples display everything (age, type, class, level and _id). If you want to display**specific** attributes say only the age you will have to add another argument to find called **projection**

eg: (1 is show, 0 is do not show):

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint prettyprinted"><code>&lt;span class="pun">{&lt;/span>&lt;span class="str">'age'&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lit">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">}&lt;/span> </code></pre>

Note here that this returns **age** as well as **_id**. _id is always returned by default. You have to explicitly tell it not to returning it as:

<pre class="lang-py prettyprint prettyprinted"><code>&lt;span class="pln">db&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">random&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">find&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">({&lt;/span> &lt;span class="str">"age"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="str">"10"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="str">"name"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="str">"ninja"&lt;/span>  &lt;span class="pun">},&lt;/span>  &lt;span class="pun">{&lt;/span>&lt;span class="str">"age"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lit">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="str">"_id"&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">:&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lit">0&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">}&lt;/span> &lt;span class="pun">)&lt;/span></code></pre>

I hope that could get you started. Take a look at the documentation is very thorough.
