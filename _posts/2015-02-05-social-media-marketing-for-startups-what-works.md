From what I came to experience from using social media for a startup am working on is that it is not as easy as everyone makes it sound. They tell you to use social media to reach wider audience and they start giving you those fancy numbers of how many users of say facebook are located say in Bahrain and how many worldwide and such. That is all useless information simply because you cannot reach them without a huge, really huge budget. The point in any marketing strategy is to convert customers and there isn&#8217;t one out of the box strategy you could just use and business starts booming you have to keep experimenting. Here is my conclusion for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

I have tried advertising in Facebook and the campaign semi worked to be honest, I got many viewers and about 0.14% converted but here I am calculating everything even the campaigns I was experimenting with. There were couple failed experiments and when I made a better ad design with a clear call to action there was a clear boost.

For Twitter and Instagram it was quite different. It seems people just bounce off when they see the low followers rate you have. Even if you utilize the common techniques like follow for follow (I think is ridiculous to just follow anyone I go for following those who talk and post about similar interest or problem you product addresses, that way you can learn more from them) they still would not follow you back and that is either for your business name, they seem to hate business names since that has been used excessively by businesses and people started to hate it or other reason is because you have few posts. The follow for follow takes up a huuuuge time unless you find a way with their APIs you will be good. Now it is not all bad news here. Here is something that really worked:  
For Twitter try to interact to as many as you can, just barge in conversations and you will see nice things. For Instagram as well try to interact as much as you can and use nice images do not use crappy ones use High quality stuff and you will see as you interact with others they will be curious as to who you are and what you do, especially if you gave out a tip of some sort and it will drag its own. Mainly be ready to invest time on it and keep interacting that is the point of social media “to interact”.
