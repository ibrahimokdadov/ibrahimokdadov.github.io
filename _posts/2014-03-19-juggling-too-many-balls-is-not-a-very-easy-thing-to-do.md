I came across a title today which was: &#8220;_**Dropped**_&#8221; and had an image of a juggler; I think the article was about a story I am not very sure.

What came through my mind when I read the title is what we always try to do. We always try to do many things at once; and rarely ever finish the important things. I one learned that the hard way (I always see that as one of the best learning methods because the outcome would stick). What I mean by the hard way here is that there were bad consequences to what I was doing.

I could summarize the bads in the following points:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211; Not able to focus well; knowing that there are many other things I have to do (I would always think that I have to always finish all at once).
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211; Forgetting things because my mind is very busy thinking and processing other things.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  &#8211; Feeling mentally tired.
</p>

I understand that what I am saying may not apply to some if not many of you but that is what I went through. After reading here and there especially the book (_4 disciplines of execution_) it was an eye opener to many things. One of the things is to focus on the wildly important goal first one at a time (max two or three) otherwise you will get carried away and eventually lead to not even finishing just one important thing.

So yes; Juggling balls is just like trying to do many things at once it would eventually drop unless you are a pro or you master it. Â Let us think of it a little:

Multi tasking is like the Juggler; you start small with one ball, try to bounce it up and down and once you feel comfortable doing that add another ball. At first it would be a little hard but then by persistence you would eventually be very comfortable juggling two balls. Once you feel comfortable you can add a third ball until you reach a limit were it would be very very difficult adding any extra balls (based on the book _4 disciplines of execution_ I think it would be best to stop at three balls). Similarly are the things we try to do in life. We start with one thing and build on it. We should think of what is the most important thing in our day that should take most of your time narrow it down to be very specific, focus on doing that (That is one task). you want to add another thing go ahead be very specific. Once you finish those move to the next ones; start by specifying them.

Here is how I apply that:

I tend to divide my time to three main parts (which are the important things I have to do; in it I specify one-three goals); the largest portion of the day goes to work (in it I specify specific tasks that I have to finish and I time how long i would spend on each and I stick to it); the second portion is learning (this part involves studying for a course, or reading from a book) third part is personal time (In it I do sports, visit family, go out a little) at the end of the day I feel that I have achieved with complete comfort what i set out to do (even if it may look like that there are not much tasks on the list). One thing I forgot to mention and is when I am in any of my task I try my best to only focus on that task alone and not to think about any other tasks. What that helps in is knowing that the other tasks have their own specified time in that sense I would execute comfortably.

So ya I hope this piece would help a little or at least makes you feel better&#8230;I hope&#8230;.

That&#8217;s all I have to say I hope you a good day&#8230;enjoy.
