2016 is here and I am here with a new opensource tool for donations called takaramOS. The idea is simple. You have things laying around and instead of selling them you want to give them away (feels good trust me). You make a post and anyone interested can call you.  
It is just like a classified platform However this one is made with donations in mind not selling.

The source code is available here:

<a href="https://github.com/ibininja/takaramOS" target="_blank">https://github.com/ibininja/takaramOS</a>

I am constantly adding features to it.

So basically

# takaramOS

A Donation platform using python and mongodb. This is platform is primarily for donations. Say you have things laying around and that you do not need. What many would tell you to do is to sell them. This platform is intended to help people give to others. Something you may not need may be very useful to someone else. Do not hold back and start giving.

This version is the alpha version many features are missing. Hopefully I will be add more features to it as time progresses. Feel free to tune in and help the way you want.
