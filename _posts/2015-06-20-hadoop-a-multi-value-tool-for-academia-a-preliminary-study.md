  I made this paper back in 2012 and submitted it to CCSEIT 2012 Conference and was accepted and meant to be included in the  proceedings published by ACM. I was requested to make small modifications, however due to personal matters I was not able to deliver on requested deadline. However I am posting it here now for anyone to read and hopefully it would be of use.

  <b>ABSTRACT</b><br /> Hadoop is one of the recent attractive tools used to process big data; it is being adopted in various sectors. Academia however is lagging behind. Adopting it in academia would add great values.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This paper presents a preliminary study to adopting Hadoop in academia. In this paper Hadoop characteristics that make it the appropriate tool to adopt in academia are presented and discussed. As this would open door for further researches in the academia context.
