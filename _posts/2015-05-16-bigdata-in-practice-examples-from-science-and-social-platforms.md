  In my previous post I have talked about Bigdata and how to get started. I tried to simplify and summarize the basics as much as possible. Today I will be listing some fields where you will definitely find bigdata implementations. The list is not limited to the examples below.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  To kick this off, let us start with International Data Corporation (IDC) (2011) prediction of that by 2020 the managed data will increase by 50 times. IDC stated in their study that by 2011 the data generated and replicated would exceed 1.8 trillion gigabytes.  In a pleasant way IDC equivalences that number to a 57.5 billion ipads of a 32GB capacity; and that if pilled would create a mountain 25 times higher than the highest mountain in Japan Mount Fuji.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It is also important to know that data come mainly in two forms either structured or unstructured. The unstructured data is data without an identifiable structure like audio, email, video&#8230;etc. You can think of structured as relational database and the unstructured anything else that would not fit the context. With that in mind let us start the examples with:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Science:</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope. Which was launched in 2000 and since then it collected 140 terabytes of data at around the years 2009-2010 (Cukier, 2010). However,  the to be telescope <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/about">the Large Synoptic Survey telescope</a> that will have 3 billion pixel camera and that will be effective as of 2016 will collect that much of data every five days  (LSST.org, 2015).

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Europe’s famous particle-physics laboratory the large Hadron Collider that is located in Geneva, Generates 40 Terabytes every second. They can’t process that much data so they only take portion of it and ditch the rest.
</p>

  The previous two examples reflect two main points when it comes to Bigdata applications. The first being Technology is a major contributor to the explosion of Bigdata. The second conclusion is that, with the constant advancement in technology more data is to be generated at speeds double what it is currently generated. This yields the importance of studying fields in Bigdata. One can only imagine the great insights and findings that could be revealed with studying that much data. Aral in (Cukier, 2010) explained that the microscope introduction to the biology field made the vast difference we see today, similarly the change the electron microscope brought to the physics world. In that sense one can only imagine what big data will impact in the future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <b>Social:</b>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Usually when most give examples of Bigdata or in many literature you will see one of the popular social networks used as an example. They are great examples to convey the concept and application and for those two reason I am going to use here Facebook and Twitter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Facebook 2011 statistics  shows that the active users exceeded 800 million (Facebook.com, 2011). If each user generates 1KB of data everyday (say a like click); that would sum up to 800 million KB of data daily and that is equivalent to 763GB. That much is generated and of course that is just an illustration, in reality users do more than just click a button. Add the tracking Facebook does even without you clicking anything  like what have you done, access time, duration&#8230;etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Similarly is Twitter; in June of 2011 Twitter announced in their blog that there are 200 million tweets per day (Twitter, 2011).  To simplify matters the ASCII encoding would be used to ease the calculations. Knowing that Twitter allows only 140 characters for each tweet; and; for each character 1 byte is needed; that would sum up to 140 bytes; noting that the ASCII example is to illustrate the numbers and does not represent Twitter’s encoding mechanism. Multiplying 140 bytes X 200 million tweets that would sum up to 28000000000 bytes, which is equivalent to 26 GB per day. Of course since 2011 alot of things have changed; so you can only imagine the number of data generated in these platforms as well as the likes like Amazon, Youtube, ebay, LinkedIn, and many others.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The previous examples I believe gave you some taste of how Bigdata impacts alot of things we do. With we can make further impacts. Of course there numerous other examples as well as fields where Bigdata is implemented in any field you could think of; say for example Finance. NASDAQ and NYSE Euronext stock exchanges have actually implemented big data solutions to handle the much data they have (Mani and Verma, 2012). You can think of any other finance entity and will realize that Bigdata is there; say a bank, think HSBC or  Standard Chartered; They definitely generate alot of data; I do not have a clear reference to how much data they generate but I can speculate that they generate alot of data especially that they operate on an international level and to keep track of operations alone would require tremendous amounts of data.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Concluding remarks:</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are many examples one could list and reflect on. Things are moving extremely fast now and those with data have the advantage over others. Everyone is trying to compete on that end now and everyone is trying hard to get more data. Clearly Bigdata brings alot to the table.
