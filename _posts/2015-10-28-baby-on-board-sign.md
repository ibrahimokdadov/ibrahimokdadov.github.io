Hello folks.

I was reading through a post today here and it came to my surprise that the sign we mostly see on cars &#8220;Baby on board&#8221; was not meant to notify other drivers that there is a baby in the car one should drive safely. rather it was meant to notify paramedics encase of accidents that there is a baby on board and this car should be attended first.

Side note: this may not be my usual tech post but I thought I put it out there for the good of the realm
