<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been introduced to some statistical concepts in the <a href="http://ibrahimokdad.com/2017/02/22/379/">previous post</a> that will aid us in understanding descriptive statistics. With those concepts in mind. I have summarized the important terms needed to fully understand the main statistical methods to be used. I will list them in a bullet point style for easier readability. Feel free to read them several times as these terms are heavily used in statistics.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Parameter</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A number that describes the population. For example average age of a population</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Constant</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Something that does not change </span><b>in the experiment </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span><b> study</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For example age of male in an Island. Male and Island here are constants. Or for example a test taken at the same time. Time here is constant.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Variables</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Characteristic that describes individual data point; ex: age of student.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Statistic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: number that describes a sample. generally called: sample statistic</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Convenience samples</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> : are samples of based on one’s convenience say friends; or specific lab researchers&#8230;etc. [random sample are always better; ]</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Hypotheses (singular hypothesis )</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are relationships between variables.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <b>Relative frequency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the frequency relation with the whole. Obtained through:  number/whole. Can also be seen as sample/population.</span>
</li>

<!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When dealing with populations or samples we tend to describe them or their variables with percentages 0-100%. Now proportion is similar however its range is 0-1. So we can use either.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualizing is always key for faster and easier description of population or sample. There are different types of visuals . The ones mostly used are graphs and to be specific </span>**histograms** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>**bar graphs. **

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Histograms are somewhat like bar charts however they have 3 main differences and are:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Their x-axis formed using Intervals which are called bins or buckets. It is basically a range. It is numerical and quantitative.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The x-axis should be ordered they cannot be mixed up. The starting is cartesian coordinates (0,0)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The y-axis hold densities in each range.</span>
</li>

**Histograms** <span style="font-weight: 400;">having bins means that we are sacrificing some details. For example when we are plotting age and decided to opt for the histogram; bins will contain ranges say the age of 10-20; clearly here we are losing the details. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We can get the bars&#8217; range through its ticks. We simply get the ticks and subtract them (t2-t1). The larger the bin ranges or sizes the larger the the corresponding frequency/density since we will be including more to each range. When bars are close together in a region in a histogram we say it is more consistent.</span>

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: Histograms not necessarily represent frequencies they can also represent percentages and fractions anything that reflects a density. Though mostly they are used for frequencies. Also with bins we can’t really tell what the center of the bin means.</span>_

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE II: </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Going for small bin sizes reduces frequencies and starts messing the shape of the distribution. That means you will get small until either there is 1 or 0 frequency for each bin. That is sooo small that barely represents any entity.</span>  
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to </span>**Bar graphs** <span style="font-weight: 400;">each bar is a distinctive category and it is not a range. bar graphs have distance between its bars unlike the histogram. Bar chart’s x-axis can be rearranged in order and it is categorical and qualitative.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Something to always keep in mind when it comes to graphs is the LABELS in their Axises. I am capitalizing on it. Labels can be misleading; always consider them. here is one: Note that “K” is a random currency that I just made up.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Say developers make 180K/year and designers make 175K/year; the above graph is all fine. It clearly reflects that they are close to each other. Now check out this (same data):</span>

[<img class="alignnone wp-image-395 size-full" src="http://ibrahimokdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/salary_misleading_image.png" alt="Bar Graph Showing Salary difference with focus on details creates misleading representation" width="600" height="463" srcset="http://ibrahimokdad.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/salary_misleading_image.png 600w, http://ibrahimokdad.site/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/salary_misleading_image-300x232.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://ibrahimokdad.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/salary_misleading_image.png)

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow Developers get paid aloooot (not really). It is the same data as the previous graph. The take from this is that It is <strong>SUPER</strong> important to always look at the labels and axises because it can be misleading.</span>

On the next chapter we will get into the core of descriptive statistics. Stay tuned.
