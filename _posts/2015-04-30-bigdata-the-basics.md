  The nice thing with starting with big data is that no matter how many different articles or resources you read you will not get confused; unlike some other fields reading from different sources can make the subject confusing.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong><strong> </strong></strong>Understanding the concept of bigdata is straightforward. However in the last few years there has been raise in frameworks and guides to developing bigdata applications; that may have made it look complex. But personally I do not think it is very important to know all of that if you are just starting with big data. Get yourself familiar with the term and the building blocks and you will easily get to know the other stuff as you start to dive deeper.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong><strong> </strong></strong>I will summarize the important things you will need to know about bigdata to give you a quick start.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong><strong> </strong></strong>Understanding what big data is, is very simple. you might have noticed in my writing that I sometimes write bigdata as a one term and some other times I separate the word BIG and DATA from each other; that is because you can think of it as a noun or as description. For me big data as the term suggest is about huge data; it does not need a complicated definition. Let us go to some dictionary and put down some synonyms for each of the terms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  starting with BIG; of its synonyms are: enormous, vast, sizable and gigantic.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  as for the term DATA, of its synonyms are: facts, figures, details, particulars and inputs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  (If Information crossed your mind and you started to confuse between the two, it is ok for now just think of DATA as an English term rather than a technical term, if you still can’t just ignore it think of it like data is for computers and information is for humans)
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now with that aside let us line up all of the synonyms together we will get what big data is all about:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <i>enormous, vast, sizable,  giagantic, facts, figures, details, particulars, inputs. </i>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That is it; what happened is that many researchers are trying to come up with a much more specific definition that adds alot of the specifics to the definition. I personally do not see that that is needed for defining bigdata. The definition should be broad and encompasses the meaning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For example Pettey Christy (2011) states bigdata as “Volume, Variety and Velocity (commonly known as the 3Vs)  “ as you can see the definition adds characteristics of big data to the definition (Similarly Sheppard, 2011). The definition should not be a topic to debate nor should it be too specific. Being specific means that the definition with its specifications are the same for everyone. That may not always be true. Say for example a definition that talks about PetaBytes What is that size to organizations like Google or Facebook? but that size to some other organizations does not even cross their mind. You see by being too specific is like saying that all entities should be the same. Do not get me wrong I am not saying that a specific definition is wrong I just think that a better definition should not be very specific. Being specific should be left for the application, When working on an application then the characteristics would matter, otherwise it should not be mentioned in the definition.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now If you think about it; the more data generated the higher a need will be for a handling mechanism to handle that data, be it software that collects and stores or a hardware that houses the stored data (we can name this step as the collection step).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Having enormous amounts of data is useless if it is just shelved and not made use of. However to make use of it, it would require processing power and time to do it. With more data the complex the process becomes. The processing power goes hand in hand with the software that would do the processing. For example if you have the processing power to handle GIGs of data but the software you have keeps freezing at an early or later point because it was not architectured to handle vast amounts of data that would all be useless; processing big data requires both hardware and software capabilities; which in some cases requires specific architecture for specific type of bigdata application (we can name this step as the processing step).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It does not stop at that; given you have the software and hardware to process data you will still need a human at the other end to make use and sense of the generated information. In Some other cases you need a software to handle the results of the processing to also make sense of that data be it machine learning or statistical results (we can name this step as the analysis step). The final step would be representation of the results it can be visualization of the output or even conclusional statistics/textual/other format.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Here is a drawing that summarizes those processes:

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong><strong> </strong></strong>You see the concept is straightforward however it may not be easy. There are a lot of details involved in each step and it can get quite complex. By understanding the steps involved in bigdata you have  made a huge leap forward. It would be easy for you now to start learning each of the steps/processes and even further specializing in any of the steps be it storage or analytics or even the representation part.
